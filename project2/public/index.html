            <h2>Long Time Internet Subjects</h2>

                <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae.</p>
                <p>Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in
                    the Near East around 7500 BC. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its
                    night vision and sense of smell
                    are well developed.</p>
                <p>It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human
                    contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.Cats possess other
                    features of their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, and
                    finely coordinated in movement.</p>

            <h2>Long Time Internet Kings</h2>
            <paras>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. Because of its retractable
                    claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.</p>
                <p>Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple low-slung bodies, finely molded heads,
                    long tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life
                    of active hunting. </p>
                <p>The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. Consequently, the
                    house cat is able to revert to complete self-reliance more quickly and more successfully than most
                    domesticated dogs.</p>
